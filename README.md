## Context

Mini application realised for a technical test.
<br />Requirements :
NodeJS (Express or Koa) for the backend.
Use any templating engine your are comfortable with (Mustache, DustJS, Jade, â€¦)
Use any front end framework your are comfortable with (Angular, React, VueJs, ...)

Plus:
Websocket (socket.io) / AJAX
SASS
Module Bundler (Gulp, Grunt, Webpack, or other)

## Tools, frameworks and technologies used
The main framework chosen is Angular 7, with Bootstrap.
I tried to use pug but the compilation keep failing, as the use of scss.
I used Bower as module bundler.
For the backend, I used nodeJS and socket.io.

## Setup

Before starting, please make sure you have the last version of nodeJS (https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/), npm (https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) and Angular CLI (https://angular.io/guide/quickstart) installed.
You might need to install g++ for compiling need so `npm install` request doesn't fail.
Then,start the server part first with the commandline `node server.js`.
Finally you can start the angular app with the commandline `ng-serve --open`.

I hope you will enjoy your visit !


N.B.: please make sure your 4400 port isn't already in use, as I already used it in this app.
