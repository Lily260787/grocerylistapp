# Grocerylist

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.0.3.

## Context

Mini application realised for a technical test.
<br />Requirements :
NodeJS (Express or Koa) for the backend.
Use any templating engine your are comfortable with (Mustache, DustJS, Jade, â€¦)
Use any front end framework your are comfortable with (Angular, React, VueJs, ...)

Plus:
Websocket (socket.io) / AJAX
SASS
Module Bundler (Gulp, Grunt, Webpack, or other)

## Tools, frameworks and technologies used
The main framework chosen is Angular 7, with Bootstrap.
I tried to use pug but the compilation keep failing, as the use of scss.
I used Bower as module bundler.
For the backend, I used nodeJS and socket.io.

## Development server
